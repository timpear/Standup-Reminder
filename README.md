This is a simple Max (cycling74.com) patch to remind you to move a little when sitting at a desk. Each dial becomes fully saturated after a set time.

The left dial (blue) means drink water and look into the distance.

The middle dial (green) means stand up and stretch for a moment.

The right dial (yellow) means go for a short walk.

I've got the times set to 12, 30, and 55 minutes. They're adjustable by typing in the little number windows.

The timer keeps going once the dial becomes saturated. Twice around and it turns red.

Click on any dial any time to reset it.
